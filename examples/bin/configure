#This is a configuration file for a Persistence Landscape Toolbox (PLT). 
#Please do not change any line starting with a hash sign

#If in your files with persistence intervals there are infinite ones, please set the
#variable right after this sentence to 1. Otherwise, please set it up to 0.
#
0
#
#If there are infinite persistence intervals (and the value above is set to 1), 
#please provide here a values which should be read as plus infinity:
#
-1
#
#If there are infinite barcodes possible, they either can be ignored or not by the PLT.
#If you do not wnat them to be ignored, please set #shallInfiniteBarcodesBeIgnored to false.
#
1
#
#If the infinite barcodes are not to be ignored and the variable shallInfiniteBarcodesBeIgnored
#is set to false, then please provide below the value which should be used by PLT in place of infinity:
#
10000000
#
#The Persistence Landscape Toolbox (PLT) can compute distances using two different
#representations of landscapes. The first, and default one, is the representation that
#uses pairs (critical point, critical value). Alternative representation, which may be
#faster in some cases, is a grid-base one. In case of grid-base representation we assume
#that the begin and end points of the intervals are sampled from a finite, uniformly
#distributed grid. If this is the case in your computations, please set the variable
#belowto true.
0
#
#in case grid is used in a computations, you need to provide a grid diameter here.
0.01

#A small number, used for a debugging purposes. Ignore when not in the debugging mode.
